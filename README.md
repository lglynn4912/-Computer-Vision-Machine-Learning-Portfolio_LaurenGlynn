## Featured Projects

### Fly Detection & Tracking (Capstone Project)
End-to-end ML pipeline for analyzing insect activity in ecological lab videos.  
- **Training**: feature extraction + Random Forest classifier, tracked with MLflow.  
- **Detection**: GPU-accelerated motion validation to detect moving insects only.  
- **Tracking**: aggregated detections into events (activity counts, durations, peaks).

### YOLO-Style Detection
Experimented with YOLO detection for insect images.  
- Compared detection accuracy with classical CV methods.  
- Studied tradeoffs in speed vs performance.

### Scene Classification with CNNs (MiniPlaces)
Built and trained a **LeNet-style CNN** from scratch on the MiniPlaces dataset (100 scene classes).  
- Designed CNN architecture with convolution, pooling, and FC layers.  
- Implemented training loop, checkpointing, and evaluation in PyTorch.  
- Applied data augmentation and optimization strategies.

## Additional Projects & Explorations
- **Insect Image-to-3D Reconstruction**  
  Experimented with single-image 3D reconstruction (DreamGaussian / Zero123) to generate coarse meshes from specimen photos.  
   Why: quick visualization for dataset QA & inspection in entomology workflows.
